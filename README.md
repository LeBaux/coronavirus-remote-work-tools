# Remote work software
Coronavirus (COVID-19) forced many people to stay and work from home.
There are loads of articles about how this will test capitalism, but not much about actual tools.
For many humans, this is the first experience with remote work in teams.
There is a plenty of free and paid software that might help these folks.
I have not found any GitHub repo/list with all software, so I'm starting one.

## Free software

Suggestions welcomed (see contributing).

1. Riot.im vs fb/whatsapp?
2. Keybase?

## Special software offers

1. **[Zoho Remotely](https://www.zoho.com/remotely/)** will remain free till July 1, 2020 by which time we hope the Coronavirus crisis tides over. We wish this is of help to all teams.

## Paid software

This is professional grade software highly regarded in tech community.

1. **Zoom.us** is currently regarded as the best video conferencing software. Works on PC, MAC, Linux, Android, iPhone. Great for work and school. Navigating all the offerings is bit complicated, but overall it is very reliable software that works well even with poor internet connection. There are currently no discounts or special offers, sadly.
2. **Slack** offers free live help session (20 minutes) for those who want to jump in ([source](https://twitter.com/stewart/status/1237815478535454722)). Doesn't feel like much of an help given the complexity of deploying slack in organisation.

## Resources and reading

1. [GitLab's Guide to All-Remote](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/guide/) was not really writing for pandemic outbreak, but it is a fairly comprehensive about remote work based on the world's largest all-remote company with over 1,200 members located in more than 65 countries around the world. It is not really talking about tools, rather issues that might arise within the company, but also issues stemming from being in isolation, such as anxiety.

## Contributing

Many software companies traditionally selling software that facilitates remote cooperation decided to offer it for free. If you know about such a "deal", please open an issue or submit a PR.

Of course traditionally free and open-source software is welcomed too, but please only include tools that don't require complicated setup. Whatever is aimed at general population.



## Todo

1. Add more free software.
2. Better formatting.
