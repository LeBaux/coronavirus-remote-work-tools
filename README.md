# Remote work software
Coronavirus (COVID-19) forced many people to stay and work from home.
For many of them, this is the first experience with remote teams.
There is a plenty of free and paid software that might help these folks.
I have not found any github repo/list with all software, so I'm starting one.

# Contributing
Many software companies traditionally selling software that faciliates remote cooperation decided to offer it for free. If you know about such a "deal", please oppen an issue or submit a PR.
Of course traidionaly free and opensource software is welcomed too, but pleaase only include tools that don't require complicated setup. Whatever is aimed at general population.
