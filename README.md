# Remote work software
Coronavirus (COVID-19) forced many people to stay and work from home.
There are loads of articles about how this will test capitalism, but not much about actual tools.
For many humans, this is the first experience with remote work in teams.
There is a plenty of free and paid software that might help these folks.
I have not found any GitHub repo/list with all software, so I'm starting one.

## Free software

Suggestions welcomed (see contributing).

1. **[Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/)** video conferencing is arguably best alternative to zoom.us. Privacy focused, no registration needed and you can run it on your own server. You can run it directly from their homepage, but you might want to find an [instance running in your country](https://framatalk.org/accueil/en/info/). ([ref](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/flx6jg/jitsi_meet_is_free_open_source_selfhosted/))
2. **[Riot.im](https://about.riot.im/)** is chat/communication software, that is free, open-source and privacy focused alternative to Discord, Slack, Microsoft Teams but also Facebook Chat/Groups and others. There is web version, but also mobile applications.
3. **[Keybase.io](https://keybase.io/)** is great mix of chat and developer tools. While I know most developers don't really need suggestion for tools, some companies still send push requests in word document, so maybe try keybase.io, that has fully encrypted chat, 250GB drive + team drive, git and even crypto wallet for some reason. Clients for all operating systems available.
4. **[Framasoft.org](https://framasoft.org/en/)** hosts a slew of free alternatives to Google tools. Free, privacy focused and transparent. Sadly, not everything is translated into English from French. Thankfully the individual tools listed on this website are usually available elsewhere, so might use this website just as directory.
5.  **[Edworking](https://edworking.com)** One platform for you and your team. Try the best experience with everything that you need for a remote work together. Your task, your chats, your files, your videoconferences working together like team.

There is also a dedicated list of more generic SaaS software that is discounted amidst COVID-19 crisis over at https://saasforcovid.com (lot of affiliate links, though).

## Paid software

This is professional grade software highly regarded in tech community (or otherwise useful).

1. **Zoom.us** is currently regarded as the best video conferencing software. Works on PC, MAC, Linux, Android, iPhone. Great for work and school. Navigating all the offerings is bit complicated, but overall it is very reliable software that works well even with poor internet connection. There are currently no discounts or special offers. [However there is a free version for mainland users and it is reportedly pretty popular, so it might come to rest of the world](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22222121). The app itself has history of privacy and security issues. [It allowed attackers to take over any Mac, recetenly also Windows installations and it shared data with Facebook](https://www.businessinsider.com/zoom-facing-multiple-reported-security-issues-amid-coronavirus-crisis-2020-4). [Zoom's CEO addressed security concerns](4/yQFZy28sY4eSr-Bk1py92gh7xIsDtcQtgYTVWAMhAcmpNNgUQLEVxl4).
2. **Miro.com** is basically online whiteboard for teams. Works well, sadly no extended free plans.
3. **Slack.com** offers free live help session (20 minutes) for those who want to jump in ([source](https://twitter.com/stewart/status/1237815478535454722)). Doesn't feel like much of an help given the complexity of deploying slack in organisation.

## Resources and reading

1. [GitLab's Guide to All-Remote](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/guide/) was not really writing for pandemic outbreak, but it is a fairly comprehensive about remote work based on the world's largest all-remote company with over 1,200 members located in more than 65 countries around the world. It is not really talking about tools, rather issues that might arise within the company, but also issues stemming from being in isolation, such as anxiety.
2. [MobileJazz handbook](https://mobilejazz.com/company-handbook-pdf/) on remote software, day-to-day etc.
3. [Rose&Rex COVID-19 family resources](https://www.roseandrex.com/pages/resources). A list of resources to help keep children engaged, calm and happy despite school closures and social distancing.
4. [Generic tips from @IwillLeaveNow](https://twitter.com/Iwillleavenow/status/1236736080751124480) about transition to remote work environment.
5. [Shopify is giving its employees $1,000 to furnish their work-from-home setups with whatever gear they need because of the coronavirus.](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-shopify-employees-work-from-home-employees-1000-bonus-office-2020-3) Hope this will inspire other companies.

## Other (hardware)

1. [ragmask.com](https://ragmask.com/) open source face mask.



## Contributing

Many software companies traditionally selling software that facilitates remote cooperation decided to offer it for free. If you know about such a "deal", please open an issue or submit a PR.

Of course traditionally free and open-source software is welcomed too, but please only include tools that don't require complicated setup. Whatever is aimed at general population.



## Todo

1. Add more free software.
2. Better formatting.
